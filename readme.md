This version is licenced under the GPL v3 licence, (see src/licence.txt)

## What’s different?

This version has been adjusted for my needs as a visual programming artist. I have made the following changes:

1. Added the commandline flag -a to turn off audio output.
2. Stopped out of the the virtual machine monitor information on the bottom of the screen
3. Changed the font colour to dark grey in order to make live coding less conspicuous

## What about the rest?
